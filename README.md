 A web and mobile platform for connecting NGOs and Restaurants using ReactJS and Flutter respectively

 We see lots of food getting wasted daily. Our application can help control the wastage by connecting the restaurants and the NGO's.
 Restaurants can keep updating the amount of food that is left over on that particular day and the NGOs can contact the restaurants using our app.
 I have developed both web app (using ReactJS) and a mobile app (using Flutter) which are connected to the Google's Firebase in order to store the details of the left over food.
 Our app provides the address and phone number of the hotels to the NGOs making the communication between them easier.
